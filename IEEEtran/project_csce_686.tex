% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}

% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmicx}
\usepackage{algpseudocode}

% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\IEEEPARstart{R}{ecurrent} neural networks (RNN) are neural networks for which the underlying graph is weighted, directed, and cyclic. As with all neural networks, the purpose of an RNN is to map an input pattern to a desired output pattern. Assuming the topology and transfer function of RNN are fixed, the accuracy of this mapping is dependent only on the synaptic weights of the network, which coorespond to the edge weights in the underlying graph. The problem of selecting edge weights, such that the difference between computed and desired output patterns is minimized, is known as the \emph{loading problem} \cite{loading_problem_for_recurrent_neural_networks_Gori2005}. The process of searching for a synaptic weight configuration which solves the loading problem is known as \emph{training} the neural network.

Several procedures exist for RNN training. The inspiration for the presented method is the error back-propagation (BP) algorithm for feed-forward neural network (FFNN) weight selection. In BP, the error produced by the network for a given set of input-output pattern pairs is propagated backward through the network, and a share of the credit for the produced error is allocated to each of the weights according to its responsibility for the error. This is called the \textit{credit assignment problem}. It is possible to assign credit in recurrent neural network using BP Through Time (BPTT) \cite{generalization_of_backpropagation_with_application_to_recurrent_gas_market_model_Werbos1988, focused_backpropagation_algorithm_for_temporal_pattern_recognition_Mozer89}, though this approach is known to be computationally expensive, and is prone to convergence to local minima \cite{rnn_are_local_minima_prone_Cuallar2006}. A novel method for assigning credit for RNN output error is proposed in this work.


\section{Approach}
The output error of an RNN is a linear combination of error terms, each corresponding to an element of the desired output pattern. Thus, to minimize the total error we must minimize the error of each output vector element. Observe that the output signal from a given neuron is the sum of weighted signals into that neuron, transformed by the activation function. If we take the activation function to be fixed, and the input signals to be incidental to the operation of the network, then we find that the weight is the only feature of the network to which we may assign blame for the produced error. Thus, if a neuron outputs a signal which results in an error with a particular direction (positive or negative), then that error must be induced by those weights which are of the same direction. Further, the larger the error-inducing weight, the more it contributes to the error. Thus, by modifying the error-inducing weight, the error may be reduced. However, this procedure only applies to those weights for which the afferent neuron has an explicitly-defined desired output value. In order to apply this procedure to all weight in the network, a mechanism for defining the error contributions of other weights must be established. Applying inductive reasoning backward through the network, we observe that the maximum credit for the error will always be assigned to the largest weight with the same sign as the error, at each neuron. However, because the underlying graph contains cycles, there is no obvious way to conclude this induction. 

An insight from the RNN loading problem domain is required to proceed. First, we define a \emph{propagation} to be the update of the output signals for all neurons in the network. A finite-time RNN produces an output vector after a fixed number of propagations, a quantity which we label $L$. Thus, only those walks, taken by an input signal, from an input neuron $u$ to an output neuron $v$, of length $L$ contribute to the output error at $v$, or $v$-error $\mathcal{E}(v)$. This walk-length constraint is sufficient to bound the induction over the structure of the underlying graph; we know that the credit assignment path for a given output neuron $v$ must end at $v$, begin at an input neuron $u$, and contain $L$ edge traversals. Thus, applying the inductive reasoning above, the weights of the edges which lie along optimum-value (maximum for positive $v$-error, minimum for negative $v$-error) walks from each input neuron to a particular output neuron constitute the greatest contributions to the $v$-error. As such, these weights should be reduced proportionally to the $v$-error. Repeating this procedure will reduce the output error of the network. We call the problem of finding the optimum-value walk of length $L$ the optimum-value walk problem (OWP). Solving the OWP on the underlying graph of an RNN yields a set of weights which, if reduced, will reduce the error of the RNN.

%Generalizing this idea, we observe that the a particular $u,v$-path contributes to the $v$-error in proportion to 

\subsection{Optimum-Value Walk Problem Specification}

Consider a directed, weight graph $G=(V,E)$. In $G$, we identify a set of input vertices $I \subseteq V(G)$ and output vertices $O \subseteq V(G)$. $I$ and $O$ may, or may not, be disjoint. Given an output vertex $v \in O$, an input vertex $u\in I$, and an optimization direction, we wish to find a walk $W$ such that the value of the walk is optimized. We define the value of a walk $w(W)$ to be 
\begin{equation}
w(W) = \sum_{e\in E(W)}w(e),
\label{eq:walk_value}
\end{equation} 
\noindent where $E(W)$ is the multiset comprising the edges traversed in $W$. Solving the OWP for all $u\in I$ and $v\in O$ yields, for each $v$, the set of $I,v$-walks of optimum value. 

\subsection{Mapping OWP to the RNN Loading Problem}

Solving the OWP on the underlying graph of an RNN provides a means to solve the loading problem. In this section, a mapping which integrates the two problems is described. The input neurons of the network are mapped to $I$, while the output neurons are mapped to $O$. We present an input pattern to the input neurons of the RNN, and perform $L$ propagations. For each $v\in O$, we compute the $v$-error $\mathcal{E}(v)$, and solve the OWP beginning at every $u\in I$, ending at $v$, and optimizing such that the value of the path is maximized if $\mathcal{E}(v)\geq0$ and is minimized otherwise. This procedure yields, for each $v$, a set $\hat{W}$, which contains the optimal-value walks from each $u\in I$ to $v$. 

$\hat{W},$ the set of comprising the optimal walks for each $u\in I$ to $v$, may be used to determine how to modify the weights. The credit for the $\mathcal{E}(v)$ assigned to a walk $W$ is proportional its optimal value, relative to the optimal value of other walks. Likewise, the credit assigned to a particular edge $e\in W$ is proportional to $w(e)$, relative to the weights of other edges in $W.$  Thus, we propose the weight-update rule
\begin{equation*}
w(e) \gets w(e) - \frac{w(e)}{w(W)}\frac{w(W)}{w(\hat{W})}\mathcal{E}(v), \quad \forall e\in E(W), \quad \forall W \in \hat{W},
\end{equation*}
\noindent which simplifies to 
%\begin{equation}
%w(e) \gets w(e) - \frac{w(e)}{w(\hat{W})}\mathcal{E}(v), \quad \forall e\in E(W), \quad W \in \hat{W}. 
%\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
w(e) \gets w(e) \left(1 - \frac{\mathcal{E}(v)}{w(\hat{W})}\right), \quad \forall e\in E(W), \forall W \in \hat{W},
\label{eq:update_rule}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
w(\hat{W}) = \sum_{W\in \hat{W}}w(W).
\label{eq:walk_set_value}
\end{equation}


The description of the OWP and the weight update rule given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:update_rule}) are sufficient to construct an algorithm which utilizes the OWP to search for solutions to the RNN loading problem. Several additional notation conventions must first be specified. $\omega$ is a weight matrix, defined such that
\begin{equation}
\omega_{ij}=w({ij}) \quad\quad \forall i,j \in V(G)\label{eq:weight_matrix}.
\end{equation}
\noindent $X$ is a data set, and is defined such that each element $x\in X$ is an ordered pair of the form 
\begin{equation*} \label{eq:data_ordered_pairs}
x=(\rchi, \lambda)=\{\rchi, \{ \rchi, \lambda \}\}
\end{equation*}
\noindent where $\rchi$ and $\lambda$ are independent sets of real numbers. $\rvarphi_L(\omega, \rchi)$ is the propagation function, which presents the pattern $\rchi$ into a neural network with weights defined by $\omega$, propagates $L$ times, and returns the output pattern. The following algorithm will adjust the weights of the network, using the described weight update procedure, once for each observation in the data set.

	The HWP is solved via depth-first search with backtracking. The root of the search tree is the tail of the walk, $u$. $u$ may be adjacent to, at most, every other neuron in the network, thus there are $n=|V(G)|$ possible edge traversals. At the next level of the search tree, each search tree node again begets $n-1$ nodes, thereby comprising a set of $(n-1)^2$ nodes. This tree growth repeats $L-1$ times. To construct the $L$th layer, all vertices must follow an edge to vertex $v$. The underlying graph of the network is simple and fully connected, so the $L$th layer has $(n-1)^{L-1}$ nodes, as each node must result in a walk which ends at $v$. Thus, the total number of nodes which must be searched is 
	\begin{align}
	(n-1)^{L-1} +\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} (n-1)^{l}.
	\end{align}	
	\noindent Therefore, the running time complexity of computing an exact solution to the HWP using DFS/BT is $\mathcal{O}(n^L)$.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.

%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%

%\subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.




\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.





% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
%


\appendices
%\section{Proof of the First Zonklar Equation}
%Appendix one text goes here.

% you can choose not to have a title for an appendix
% if you want by leaving the argument blank
%\section{}
%Appendix two text goes here.
